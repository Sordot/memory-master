Project Summary: This is a basic memory/matching game which takes advtantage of React's useState hooks to manage when the cards should be flipped. 
It uses CSS magic to layer the two card images on top of each other (card front and card back) and swaps them when the card is selected.

Additional Functionality: New Game button which resets game state without refreshing the page. Turn counter which uses the prev property of the useState hook to stay updated.
